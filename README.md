CPFP (Child Pays for Parent) Calculator

This is a tool to help you calculate a fee rate to choose for a CPFP transaction, which will result in an effective fee rate for the original transaction that is very close to the current high prioirty fee rate.

IMPORTANT: This tool assumes the CPFP transaction will use 1 input and 1 output, the simpliest method of achieving a CPFP acceleration. It also assumes no other CPFP or RBF accelerations are involved.
